## Two Generalized Use Cases

There are two main use cases quoted in the Working Group's Charter:

1. An **end user** requires some convenient data for a specific, familiar purpose, such as a forecast surface temperature at a point or over an area, or a timeseries of water flow at a river location, or wind speed and direction along a proposed trajectory or route. However the user does not need the full range of data that modern weather or climate predictions, or other Big Data systems, provide, or even a significant subset.

2. A **service provider** of many value-added products and information services needs an architecture that decouples the provision of data to many evolving distributed applications from the underlying stable, operational, centralized bulk data production systems.

The underlying bulk data may be based on regular calculation grids as used in numerical weather prediction or environmental modelling, or may be point-cloud observation based, or other structures.
