# Environmental Data Retrieval Web Use Cases & Requirements 

## 1. Abstract
This folder contains the use cases that demand a combination of spatio-temporal data sources, such as weather, environmental, or other information, and a range of techniques. It underpins the collaborative work of the Environmental Data Retrieval API Standard Working Group of the Open Geospatial Consortium and the Met Ocean Domain Working Group.

## 2. Introduction
The purpose of the Environmental Data Retrieval API Use Cases is to clarify and formalise the spatio-temporal related standards landscape that enables the development and use of spatio-temporal based web services: 

- to determine how spatio-temporal information can best be integrated with other data on the Web; 
- to define a range of access patterns and encoding extensions that cover a set of core use cases specified; 
- to identify and assess existing methods and tools; 
- to drive consensus on spatio-temporal standards for the web;
- and to produce a set of best practices for the use of the standards for weather information on the web. This will be pursued via the Met Ocean Domain Working Group.

This folder describes a set of evolving use cases which are the first steps of working towards these goals. Members of the Standard Working Group and other stakeholders are working collaboratively to define a number of use cases that describe how spatio-temporal information such as environmental and weather on the Web could work. From these use cases, a number of requirements for further work are derived. In this folder, use cases, requirements and their relationships will be described. Requirements and use cases are also related to the deliverables of the Working Group which are defined in the root readme.md file. The requirements described in this folder will be the basis for development of the other deliverables of the Working Group.

As the OGC  API - EDR is designed to be compatible with the OGC API - Features standard, and also underpinned by the emerging OGC API-Common core of the API standards, some use cases are closely tied to feature retrieval.  Other use cases show how the OGC API - EDR can be used to query data stores with coordinates that may not be geospatial, such as local or engineering coordinate systems.
