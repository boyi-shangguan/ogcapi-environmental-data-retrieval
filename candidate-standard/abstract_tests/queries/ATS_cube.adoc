^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/cube*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that an error is returned by a `Cube` query if no query parameters are specified.
^|Requirement |<<req_area,/req/queries/cube>>
^|Test Method |. No query parameters are specified
. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 400.

^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/cube*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that an error is returned by a `Cube` query when the `coords` query parameter is not specified.
^|Requirement |<<req_area,/req/queries/cube>>
^|Test Method |. coords query parameter is not specified
. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 400.

^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/cube*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that an error is returned by a `Cube` query when the `min-z` query parameter is not specified.
^|Requirement |<<req_area,/req/queries/cube>>
^|Test Method |. Check that the min-z query parameter is specified (i.e. check there is a defined bottom of the cube)
. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 400.

^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/cube*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that an error is returned by a `Cube` query when the `max-z` query parameter is not specified.
^|Requirement |<<req_area,/req/queries/cube>>
^|Test Method |. Check that the max-z query parameter is specified (i.e. check that the top of the cube is defined)
. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 400.

^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/cube*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that an error is returned by a `Cube` query when the coords query parameter does not contain a valid POLYGON Well Known Text value.
^|Requirement |<<req_area,/req/queries/cube>>
^|Test Method |. Check coords query parameter is *Rectangular* area defined using a valid Well Known Text Polygon value, if the Well Known Text Polygon is not a rectangle throw an error  
. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 400.

^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/cube*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that resources can be identified and extracted from a Collection with a `Cube` query using  query parameters.
^|Requirement |<<req_area,/req/queries/cube>>
^|Test Method |. Test with valid query parameters
. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 200.

Repeat these tests using the following parameter tests:

* Response <<../../requirements/edr/REQ_rc-max-z-response,/conf/edr/max-z-response>>

*Parameters*
* Parameter <<../../requirements/collections/edr/REQ_rc-parameter-definition,/conf/collections/rc-parameter-name-definition>>
* Response <<../../requirements/collections/edr/REQ_rc-parameter-response,/conf/collections/rc-parameter-name-response>>

*DateTime*

Execute requests with combinations of the "coords","time","parameter-name","min-z","max-z","crs" and "f" query parameters
and verify that only information that matches the selection criteria is returned.
