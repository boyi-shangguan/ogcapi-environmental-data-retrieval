^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/position*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that an error is returned by a `Position` query if no query parameters are specified.
^|Requirement |<<req_position,/req/queries/position>>
^|Test Method |. No query parameters are specified
. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 400.

^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/position*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that an error is returned by a `Position` query when the coords query parameter is not specified.
^|Requirement |<<rreq_position,/req/queries/position>>
^|Test Method |. coords query parameter is not specified
. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 400.

^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/position*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that an error is returned by a `Position` query when the coords query parameter does not contain a valid POINT Well Known Text value.
^|Requirement |<<rreq_position,/req/queries/position>>
^|Test Method |. Check coords query parameter is a valid Well Known Text Point value 
. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 400.

^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/position*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that resources can be identified and extracted from a Collection with a `Position` query using  query parameters.
^|Requirement |<<req_position,/req/queries/position>>
^|Test Method |. Test with valid query parameters
. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 200.

Execute requests with combinations of the "coords","time","parameter-name","z","crs" and "f" query parameters
and verify that only information that matches the selection criteria is returned.
