^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/locations*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that a list of valid locations are returned by a `Locations` query if no query parameters are specified.
^|Requirement |<<req_locations,/req/queries/locations>>
^|Test Method |. No query parameters are specified
. Validate that a GeoJSON document was returned with a status code 200 containing at least a list of features one for each location supported by the collection.

^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/locations*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that an error is returned by a `Locations` query when the the locationId is invalid.
^|Requirement |<<req_locations,/req/queries/locations>>
^|Test Method |. Check that invalid `locationId` values return an error message
. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 404.

^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/locations*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that resources can be identified and extracted from a Collection with a `Locations` query using  query parameters.
^|Requirement |<<req_locations,/req/queries/locations>>
^|Test Method |. Test with valid query parameters
. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 200.

Repeat these tests using the following parameter tests:

*Parameters*
* Parameter <<../../requirements/collections/edr/REQ_rc-parameter-definition,/conf/collections/rc-parameter-name-definition>>
* Response <<../../requirements/collections/edr/REQ_rc-parameter-response,/conf/collections/rc-parameter-name-response>>

*DateTime*

* Parameter <<../../requirements/collections/edr/REQ_rc-time-definition,/conf/collections/rc-time-definition>>
* Response <<../../requirements/collections/edr/REQ_rc-time-response,/conf/collections/rc-time-response>>

Execute requests with combinations of the "time","parameter-name","crs" and "f" query parameters
and verify that only information that matches the selection criteria is returned.
