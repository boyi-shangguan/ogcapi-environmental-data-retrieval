^|A | If the `resolution-y` parameter is provided, denotes the number of intervals to retrieve data for along the path between the minimum and maximum y coordinates  
^|B | The total number of intervals includes the values for the minimum and maximum coordinates 
^|C | A `resolution-y` value of 0 MUST return all available data at the native y resolution between the minimum and maximum coordinates   
^|D | IF `resolution-y` is not specified data should be returned for just the locations specified in the requested coordinates (**ONLY IF** interpolation is supported by the API)
