===== Parameter locationID

With the locations query a position is defined by a unique identifier that is a string value.  It can be anything as long as it is unique for the required position, for instance a GeoHash `gbsvn` or a WMO station id like `03772`, what3words like `bolt.lime.metro` or place name like `Devon`.  The metadata returned by the API must supply a geospatial definition for the identifier.
